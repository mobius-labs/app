# Handling Assets

[[back to README]](../README.md)

## Images

Place them in `frontend/src/assets`, and reference them in your code. Webpack will bundle them into the final build automatically.

## Icons

Our frontend imports all the free FontAwesome 5 icons.
See also a [list of available icons](https://fontawesome.com/v5.15/icons).
